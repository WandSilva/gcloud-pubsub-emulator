> This project was developed to help the usage of [Pub/Sub Emulator](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator) for testing on localhost or development environment.

### Python Scripts

They scripts provided by this repository have been created to support the management of **Topics** and **Subscriptions**. Those scripts are based on the resources provided by [googleapis/python-pubsub](https://github.com/googleapis/python-pubsub).

### Adjusments and Improvements

The project is under construction and the next updates will cover the following topics:

- [ ] Real usage example (or very similar to a real usage);
- [ ] Support for Avro schemas

## üíª Prerequisites

Before starting, verify if you have the following requisites:

* Python 3.10
* Docker

## üöÄ Setup

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:WandSilva/gcloud-pubsub-emulator.git
```

In the `gcloud-pubsub-emulator` folder, install the Python dependencies using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):
```bash
poetry install
```

## ‚òï Usage

Please follow the initial steps in the order below.

First, spawn the Poetry shell. This session will be used on the remaining instructions:
```bash
poetry shell
```



Export the required environment variables. You must replace `<fake-project-id>` by any project ID that you want, it won't represent a real Google Cloud project because the Pub/Sub emulator runs locally:
```
export PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8085
export PUBSUB_PROJECT_ID=<fake-project-id>
```
just make sure your service is trying to connect to pubsub using the same project id
 
Start the Emulator:
```bash
make up
```

### Managing a PubSub Topic

* Create a Topic
  ```sh
  python3 pubsub-utils/publisher.py create <topic-1> <topic-N>
  ```
* Delete a Topic
  ```sh
  python3 pubsub-utils/publisher.py delete <topic-1> <topic-N>
  ```
* List topics
  ```sh
  python3 pubsub-utils/publisher.py list
  ```
* Publish a message in a topic \*\*
  ```sh
  python3 pubsub-utils/publisher.py publish <topic_id>
  ```

\*\* The message hasn't been passed by parameter yet, so to send custom messages, it's mandatory to edit the `publisher.publish_in_topic()`.

### Managing PubSub Subscriptions


* Create a Subscription
  ```sh
  python3 pubsub-utils/subscriber.py create --topics <topic-1> <topic-N> --subscriptions <sub-1> <sub-N> 
  ```
* Delete a Subscription
  ```sh
  python3 pubsub-utils/subscriber.py delete <subcscrption_id>
  ```
* List all subscriptions in a given project
  ```sh
  python3 pubsub-utils/subscriber.py list-in-project
  ```
* List all subscriptions in a topic
  ```sh
  python3 pubsub-utils/subscriber.py list-in-topic <topic_id>
  ```
